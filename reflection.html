    <p>Responsive design means making a website that works well on any device, whether it’s a big computer screen, a tablet, or a small phone. The website changes its layout and size so that everything is easy to read and use, no matter what screen the person has. It’s like water in a glass — the water takes the shape of the glass, and a responsive website takes the shape of the screen. This way, people don’t have to zoom in or scroll sideways, and the site always looks neat and simple to use.</p>

    <p>Responsive design is very important in web development today because people use so many different devices. Some use big monitors, some use laptops, and a lot of people use their phones for almost everything. By using web technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, we can make pages that automatically adjust. For example, CSS media queries let you write different styles depending on the screen size. Images can also be made flexible so they shrink or grow to fit the screen. Some developers use frameworks like Bootstrap, but you can also make responsive layouts without them by using flexible grids and relative units like percentages.</p>

    <p>When I was building my own pages, I learned that starting with a “mobile-first” design is easier. It means you first make the page look good on a small screen, and then you add changes for bigger screens. This is better than making a big-screen design and then trying to squeeze it into a phone. I also learned not to use fixed widths, because they can break the design on smaller devices. Instead, using flexible layouts, relative font sizes, and making sure buttons and links are easy to tap makes a big difference.</p>

    <p>Through my research, I found that responsive design is not only about making things fit on the screen. It’s also about thinking how people will use the website. On a phone, they use their fingers to tap, so buttons need to be big enough. On a desktop, they use a mouse, so you can have smaller controls. Loading speed is also important, especially for mobile users who might have slower internet. Testing your website on different devices or using browser tools to simulate them is a very useful habit.</p>

    <p>In this course, I learned more than just coding. I learned how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to make a full web page. HTML is the structure, CSS is the style, and JavaScript adds the interactivity. This separation makes the code easier to manage and understand. I also learned how to validate forms so that users enter correct information before submitting. This is something I had seen on websites before but never understood how it worked.</p>

    <p>My learning experience in WEB222 has been positive. At first, it felt a little challenging because there were so many new things to remember. But as I practiced, I started to understand how everything connects. Making a project about Sri Lanka was special for me because it let me share something about my culture while also practicing my skills. I also liked that the assignments were practical, so every task felt like building part of a real website.</p>

    <p>Overall, I feel more confident now. I know this is just the beginning, but I am excited to learn more about web development. I want to explore more advanced topics in the future, but the basics I learned here will help me with any website I build. This course taught me to think about both design and function, and I now understand that a good website is one that works for everyone, everywhere.</p>
